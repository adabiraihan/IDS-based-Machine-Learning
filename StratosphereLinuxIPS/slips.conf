# This configuration file controls several aspects of the working of Slips


#####################
# [1] Input Processing

#####################
# [2] Logging of Errors
# This controls the debug output of slips in a log file. The logging is related to errors and situations about the working of the program.
[logging]
logfile = ./slips.log
# Minimum debug level to show. From the level selected, down, everything will be shown
# logging.DEBUG    Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
# logging.INFO    Confirmation that things are working as expected.
# logging.WARNING    An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.
# logging.ERROR    Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
# logging.CRITICAL    A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.
loglevel = WARNING
# The loglevel works for the file, but the console log is fixed to CRITICAL. This is different from the debug parameter.

# In the _all_ configuration we still only create 1 profile for each IP in the home net (opposite to 1 profile for each external IP connecting to the home net), but when the external IPs connect to the hosts int he home net, we process that traffic also.
