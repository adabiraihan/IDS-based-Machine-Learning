Slips v0.8.1
============================

The tool is available on GitHub `here <https://github.com/stratosphereips/StratosphereLinuxIPS/tree/master>`_.

**Slips** is a Python-based intrusion prevention system that uses machine learning to detect malicious behaviors in the network traffic. Slips was designed to focus on targeted attacks, to detect of command and control channelsi, and to provide good visualisation for the analyst. Slips is able to analyze real live traffic from the device and the large network captures in the type of a pcap files, Suricata, Zeek/Bro and Argus flows. As a result, Slips highlights suspicious behaviour and connections that needs to be deeper analyzed.

This documentation gives an overview how Slips works, how to use it and how to help. To be specific, that table of contents goes as follows:


- **Installation**. Instructions to install Slips in a Docker and in a computer. See :doc:`Installation <installation>`.

- **Usage**. Instructions and examples how to run Slips with different type of files and analyze the traffic using Slips and its GUI Kalipso. See :doc:`Usage <usage>`.

- **Detection modules**. Explanation of detection modules in Slips, types of input and output. See :doc:`Detection modules <detection_modules>`.

- **Architecture**. Internal architecture of Slips (profiles, timewindows), the use of Zeek and connection to Redis. See :doc:`Architecture <architecture>`.
  
- **Training with your own data**. Explanation on how to re-train the machine learning system of Slips with your own traffic (normal or malicious).See :doc:`Training <training>`. 

- **Thread Intelligence**. Explanation on how Slips works with the threat intelligence feeds.See :doc:`Threat Intelligence <threatintelligence>`. 

- **Detections per Flow**. Explanation on how Slips works to make detections on each flow with different techniques. See :doc:`Flow Alerts <flowalerts>`. 

- **IP Info**. Explanation on how Slips gets information about each IP address for the module IP_Info. See :doc:`IP Info <ipinfo>`.

- **Exporting**. The exporting module allows Slips to export to Slack and STIX servers. See :doc:`Exporting <exporting>`.

- **Contributing**. Explanation how to contribute to Slips, and instructions how to implement new detection module in Slips. See :doc:`Contributing <contributing>`.
