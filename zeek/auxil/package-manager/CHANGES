2.12.0 | 2021-10-12 13:58:09 -0700

  * Release 2.12.0.

2.11.0-18 | 2021-10-12 13:57:17 -0700

  * Support testing package dependencies in Manager.test() (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Interpolate test_command (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Strengthen the installation-staging concept (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Update baseline of test affected by new package install order (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Consistently modify the environment during staging and testing (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Install/upgrade packages in reverse dependency order (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Ensure breadth-first reporting of new nodes in Manager.validate_dependencies() (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Install executables during staging (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

2.11.0-4 | 2021-08-16 14:04:35 -0700

  * Accept `uninstall` as an alias for `remove`. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * Incorporate sphinx-argparse upstream fix for aliased commands (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

2.11.0 | 2021-07-05 20:58:29 -0700

  * Release 2.11.0.

2.10.0-10 | 2021-07-05 20:53:39 -0700

  * Require zeek-config for two additional tests that will fail without it (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Add --fail-on-aggregate-problems to the refresh command (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    When provided (in addition to --aggregate), any package metadata processing
    problems cause zkg to exit with error. Without the flag, such problems only
    trigger a warning.

  * Added resilience when specifying local paths as package git repos (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    In addition to failing when a given path doesn't exist, the git.Repo()
    constructor also fails when a given path exists but is not a git
    repository. That scenario caused backtraces with package installs,
    testing, and bundling when providing such invalid local paths.

    We now check for this case and provide according output. This adds
    guards for the install, test, and bundling commands, which are the
    entry points for providing local URLs.

    This also expands the test case for invalid repos.

  * Fix crash in case the user enters just "zkg template" (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    The output of "zkg template" (which will gain various commands over
    time) now mirrors that when just saying "zkg". Also, the help output
    in `zkg template --help` no longer double-mentions "template".

2.10.0 | 2021-06-21 19:51:19 -0700

  * Release 2.10.0.

2.9.0-10 | 2021-06-21 19:08:22 -0700

  * When zkg is bundled with Zeek, prepend Zeek's Python module path (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    Prepending instead of appending ensures that the bundled zkg picks the
    zeekpkg module shipped with Zeek, not any others available elsewhere
    in Python's search path.

  * Improve the package source refresh test (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This test now also verifies the "refresh --push" behavior. To do this
    it makes the "remote" package source bare and verifies the log zkg
    generates at the debug level, with a bit of additional canonification.

    For better output filtering, the diff-remove-abspath canonifier now
    recognizes whitespace (it's the same as used by Zeek), and
    diff-remove-zkg-version now actually filters the current zkg version,
    not just a related token that appeared in one test.

  * Add logging to package source refreshes (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    At log level INFO zkg now reports whether the local aggregate.meta was
    dirty during a "refresh --push" and thus led to a commit; at log level
    DEBUG it also reports the package additions/changes/drops that end up
    in such a commit.

  * Harden "@" interpretation in package source URLs (Christian Kreibich and Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    urlparse parses scp-style git URLs ("git@github.com:foo/bar") crudely
    as path-only URLs, exposing us to a risk of confusing user@ prefixes
    with @version suffixes. We now look for scp-style URLs and transform
    those explicitly to the "ssh://" schema to disambiguate.

2.9.0-1 | 2021-05-27 13:46:33 -0700

  * Update Python requirement to 3.6+ (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Some new code that came in with zkg 2.9.0 does indeed use Python
    3.6 features (f-strings), but also early Python versions are generally
    end-of-life already.

2.9.0 | 2021-05-18 15:07:05 -0700

  * Release 2.9.0.

2.8.0-24 | 2021-05-18 15:06:32 -0700

  * Add an baseline canonifier to user-mode btest (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Change templating API_VERSION to 1.0.0 (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.8.0-22 | 2021-05-18 13:13:17 -0700

  * Minor docstring formatting improvements (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add 'uservar' and 'template' modules to API docs (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix sphinxarg extension's use of old Sphinx logging API (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.8.0-19 | 2021-05-18 12:03:36 -0700

  * Minor developer guide tweaks (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.8.0-18 | 2021-04-28 12:21:12 -0700

  * Add "template info" command (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    "template info" shows information about the provided template (or
    the default), in either JSON or plaintext. This verifies whether
    a given template is loadable and reports supported features,
    user vars, and tagged versions.

  * Provide default branch name in our git wrapper (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    Newer git versions trigger a warning when the default branch name is
    not set, which cluttered up the logs. This adds the default name,
    preserving "master" since that branch name is currently visible in
    test baselines.

  * Add templating functionality to zkg toplevel script (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    - Provide "zkg create" to instantiate a template, with optional
    features and user vars for parameterization.

    - ZKG_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE points at the default template repo,
    https://github.com/zeek/package-template.

  * Add a "slug" helper for user vars (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    For templates it'll often be handy to render a variable value into a
    file-system-safe identifier ("slug"). This provides uservar.slugify()
    for this purpose.

  * Add Zeek package templating module (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This provides infrastructure for structuring and instantiating Zeek
    package templates. Templates are standalone git repos, managed as
    follows:

    - Template objects define package templates, including an output
    directory, a specific package template, any additional features, and
    parameters substituted when instantiating. Parameters derive from user
    variables in a way defined by the template.

    - The Package and Feature classes model template content and allow
    validation of input parameters and instantiation of content. The
    package class has additional functionality for initializing new
    packages as git repos and adding template metadata to its zkg.meta.

    - A hierarchy of exceptions accommodates template-specific problems.

    These aren't currently imported into the zeekpkg namespace -- you need
    to use zeekpkg.template.* when accessing those components.

  * Add _util.load_source() for sourcing a Python script as a module (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    Templates are driven by a toplevel __init__.py script, which we source
    via this function.

  * Prefill the prompt for user vars with current value (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This preserves the current model of allowing a quick hit of enter to
    confirm the existing value, but also lets you empty out the value to
    provide an empty string as the new value.

  * Refactor user vars into their own class and module (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    - Moves user-var functionality to a new uservar module and adds
    UserVar, a class representing an individual user variable. These can
    be created explicitly, parsed from a dict, or parsed from a NAME=VAL
    string.

    - Adds support for --user-arg NAME=VAL for the install, unbundle, and
    upgrade commands. This can be provided repeatedly and lets you provide
    user variables via the command line.

    - Slightly tweaks the user prompt to accommodate situations other than
    package installation.

  * Migrate some git helpers to _util for broader access (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

2.8.0 | 2021-03-26 16:50:59 -0700

  * Release 2.8.0.

2.7.1-13 | 2021-03-26 16:50:20 -0700

  * Check existence of executables only after the build process. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

2.7.1-11 | 2021-03-24 18:05:00 -0700

  * GH-101: include exception output in dependency import error messages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.7.1-9 | 2021-03-24 15:38:03 -0700

  * Add support for packages shipping executables. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    This introduces a new "executables" metadata field that a package can
    set to scripts or binaries that it wants to make available to users. On
    package installation, zkg will link these executables into a new,
    central "bin_dir" that users can put into their PATH. By default, that's
    "<state>/bin", but it can be relocated through a corresponding "bin_dir"
    entry in the configuration file. On package removal, these symlinks get
    removed from "bin_dir". Users can automatically update their path
    through something like PATH=$(zkg config bin_dir):$PATH.

2.7.1-7 | 2021-03-05 16:39:22 -0800

  * Update plugin used in test suite for Zeek 4.1 compatibility (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update test baselines to include btest header info (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.7.1-5 | 2021-03-05 15:56:09 -0800

  * Prevent local githooks from interfering with zkg's commands (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This adds --no-verify during git commits and pushes to prevent githook
    interference.

  * Prevent local githooks from interfering with the testsuite (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This adds a git wrapper script that skips any git configuration done in
    the user's home, including typical local git hooks.

  * Update CI to test Zeek 4.0 and not test 3.2 anymore (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.7.1 | 2021-02-05 15:29:59 -0800

  * Release 2.7.1.

2.7.0-2 | 2021-02-05 15:29:41 -0800

  * Teach autoconfig command the --force option (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Allows for skipping confirmation prompts

2.7.0 | 2021-01-25 12:05:08 -0800

  * Release 2.7.0.

2.6.1-7 | 2021-01-25 11:54:28 -0800

  * Documentation updates for user mode (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Expand use of environment variables to override internal settings (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    - ZKG_DEFAULT_SOURCE allows setting an alternative default package
      source when https://github.com/zeek/packages isn't desirable. An
      empty value causes no source to be defined.

    - ZEEK_ZKG_CONFIG_DIR and ZEEK_ZKG_STATE_DIR allow overriding internal
      storage locations configured during a Zeek-bundled install. This is
      mainly to aid testing, so the help output does not include these.

  * Suggest use of --user when zkg detects write-permission problems (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Add user mode to zkg (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    The --user flag forces zkg to manage state, including scripts and
    plugin directories, in ~/.zkg. --user is mutually exclusive to
    --configfile, and also overrides any ZKG_CONFIG_FILE environment
    variable.

    The flag exists for all commands, so you can also use e.g. autoconfig
    to write out a config file with those settings. As before, "zkg env"
    reports the environment variables required for operating Zeek with
    these settings.

  * Avoid reporting repeated paths in "zkg env" (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

2.6.1 | 2021-01-06 21:35:39 -0800

  * Release 2.6.1.

2.6.0-8 | 2021-01-06 21:33:22 -0800

  * Remove unneeded Python module imports (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove excess argument to a string format() (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove an unreachable return statement (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6.0-5 | 2021-01-06 21:02:09 -0800

  * Fix missing argument to a function in dependency analysis logic (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6.0-4 | 2021-01-06 20:52:13 -0800

  * When installed as a subproject of Zeek, automatically add its bin/ to PATH (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This helps package installations succeed that require executables from
    that directory, such as zeek-config.

2.6.0 | 2020-12-12 21:20:21 -0800

  * Release 2.6.0.

2.5.0-12 | 2020-12-12 21:18:34 -0800

  * Update quickstart docs to note zkg comes installed with Zeek 4.0.0+ (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Install zkg.1 man page as part of CMake builds (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.5.0-10 | 2020-12-12 20:21:32 -0800

  * Support cmake-driven installation of zkg when bundled with Zeek (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This adds cmake-level templating of the toplevel zkg script to substitute
    paths that let zkg find its own module. When installing independently,
    this mechanism has no effect, since the zeekpkg module continues to be
    found via usual PYTHONPATH mechanisms.

    The templating also lets us adjust the default location of the config
    and state directories, since in Zeek-bundled installs they are
    separate.

2.5.0-8 | 2020-12-10 15:25:50 -0800

  * Add explanatory error message to zkg for failed imports of dependencies (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    If the external gitpython or semantic-version dependencies aren't
    available when running `zkg`, it now shows an error messages to explain
    what's required and an example of how to install them.

2.5.0-7 | 2020-12-07 17:19:11 -0800

  * Replace remaining use of Thread.isAlive with Thread.is_alive (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    isAlive() has been deprecated for a while. Python 3.9 (Fedora 33's
    default) no longer includes it, which broke the metadata-depends and
    metadata-suggests tests.

2.5.0-4 | 2020-12-04 12:43:42 -0800

  * Remove deprecated bro-pkg script and bropkg module (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The PyPI bro-pkg package will also no longer be kept in sync with zkg.

  * Simplify configparser imports/usages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove future print_function imports (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove configparser from requirements.txt (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.5.0 | 2020-12-04 10:30:29 -0800

  * Release 2.5.0.

2.4.2-9 | 2020-12-04 10:28:22 -0800

  * Extend test suite to cover a package with a "main" default branch (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    As opposed to historical default of "master" being the convention.

  * GH-76: Detect default branch name of packages automatically (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Rather than use the hardcoded 'master' branch as the conventional
    default, zkg will now attempt to select a package's default branch as
    follows:

    If there is a remote named 'origin' and it has a HEAD reference,
    whatever branch that points to is taken to be the default branch.

    If there is not a remote named 'origin' or it does not have a HEAD,
    then the default branch is selected in this order: 'main' if it exists,
    'master' if it exists, the currently active branch (HEAD) if there is
    one, else the commit hash of the current detached head.

    Note that zkg still prioritized release version tags, like 'v1.0.0',
    over branches and the default branch selection logic only applies
    when no such release version tag exists.

  * Make test cases resilient to non-master default git branch names (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.4.2-5 | 2020-11-26 17:38:59 +0000

  * Update pip invocations to use explicit `pip3` (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove Python compatibility logic for versions less than 3.5 (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update Python invocations to use explicit `python3` (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update documentation to reflect new minimum Python 3.5 requirement (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.4.2 | 2020-11-10 15:18:54 -0800

  * Release 2.4.2.

2.4.1-5 | 2020-11-10 15:17:45 -0800

  * Fix/improve dependency resolution failure messages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The no_best_version_string() function was incorrectly returning a tuple
    instead of a string.

  * GH-83: Fix branch-based dependency analysis for packages with no tags (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Branch-based dependency analysis was incorrectly skipped for packages
    that had no release version tags.

  * GH-82: Enforce dependency requirements of already-installed packages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Treat as an error the installing a package that would break dependency
    requirements of an already-installed package.

2.4.1 | 2020-11-03 14:55:16 -0800

  * Release 2.4.1.

2.4.0-13 | 2020-11-03 14:52:09 -0800

  * Improve "remove" operation to not unload already-unloaded dependencies (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve how "unload" operation manages dependencies (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    * Added a confirmation prompt for the "unload" operation
      and a `--force` option to bypass it

    * The confirmation prompt now lists all dependent packages that
      will also be unloaded as part of the request

  * Rename the "runtime dependency management" btest (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-78: Improve structure/output of "remove" operations (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    * Previously, the remove operation would indicate that all other
      installed packages besides the one being removed were dependent
      and needed to be unloaded.  No such action would ever happen, it
      was just incorrect/extraneous output.

    * Previously, a second "Proceed?" prompt would appear (as part of the
      logic to ask if it's alright to unload dependers) even if there's
      only a single, independent package being removed.

    * With this change, the entire set of depender-packages is gathered
      up front to display both packages-to-remove and packages-to-unload
      within the a single "Proceed?" prompt.  This makes it clear what the
      overall results of the remove operation will be right away rather than
      prompt per package-to-remove asking just-in-time if it's ok to unload
      dependers.  That is, easier for user to make a single decision at the
      start rather than find out midway that something isn't to their liking
      and abort then, possibly leaving things in an undesirable state that
      still needs sorting out.

      This is also helps streamline the final output of the resulting
      unload/remove operations which was previously hard to parse since it
      included redundant information about which were unloaded and also
      unimportant errors like saying a package couldn't be unloaded at a
      certain point because it was still in use by another package except
      that other package was later scheduled to also be unloaded, making
      that error moot.

  * Fix various docstring typos/mistakes (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-79: fix dependency-aware (un)loading logic to ignore "reserved" names (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Both `Manager.load_with_dependencies()` and
    `Manger.unload_with_unused_dependers()` previously could find a package
    depending on "zeek" (or "zkg") and consider that as the name of a
    package to (un)load as part of the operation and fail since they're not
    real packages that are installed.  Those operations now simply skip over
    such reserved names when walking the dependency graph since there's
    nothing to do for them.

2.4.0-2 | 2020-11-02 13:38:01 -0800

  * Remove superfluous "fetch" during git cloning (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Fetching tags used to be necessary for shallow clones, but that now
    happens implicitly since changing to use `git clone --no-single-branch`
    (which is also needed for zkg's branch-based version tracking).

    A secondary `git fetch` after doing a shallow clone also has negative
    effect of causing errors on older git versions (e.g. v1.8.3.1, currently
    found in CentOS 7) since they prohibit fetching from a shallow clone.

2.4.0 | 2020-10-20 15:45:32 -0700

  * Release 2.4.0.

2.3.1-2 | 2020-10-20 14:26:32 -0700

  * GH-74: handle `git checkout` failures during `zkg refresh --aggregate` (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Previously, a checkout failure caused the entire aggregation process
    to fail, now it will just skip the offending package and later emit
    a warning that it could not collect its associated metadata.

2.3.1-1 | 2020-10-20 13:37:16 -0700

  * GH-75: show more warnings from `zkg refresh --aggregate` (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Package metadata collection issues (e.g. missing metadata file) were not
    previously surfaced (except when using `zkg -v` verbosity), but these
    might always be interesting to know about for those performing the
    aggregation themselves.

2.3.1 | 2020-09-25 12:24:47 -0700

  * Release 2.3.1.

2.3.0-5 | 2020-09-25 12:22:22 -0700

  * GH-70: When running tests, use any already installed dependencies (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    Rather than rebuilding them.

  * Small tweak to -v to turn any count >= 3 into debug. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Simplify installation thread "progress ticks" logic (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    And canonify the "runtime" test baseline to not depend on any particular
    duration required to join() the installing-thread.

2.3.0 | 2020-09-21 16:50:10 -0700

  * Release 2.3.0.

  * Add `package_base` as a pre-defined configuration key for value interpolation.

    This enables a package to gain access to files from another package in
    a well-defined manner. For example, if package `foo` wants to access
    file `xyz.cfg` from package "bar", it can now declate `bar` as a
    dependency and then use `%(package_base)s/bar/xyz.cfg` from its
    `build_command`. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

2.2.1-2 | 2020-08-10 15:41:16 -0700

  * Bump CI to use Zeek 3.2.0 (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.2.1 | 2020-08-04 18:20:09 -0700

  * Release 2.2.1.

2.2.0-2 | 2020-08-04 17:56:08 -0700

  * Improve zkg prompt for unloading of dependent packages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Prevent a package that has no scripts from autoloading (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    If a package has no scripts, explicitly prevent it from being added to
    the packages.zeek "autoloader" script since that won't ever work.

2.2.0 | 2020-07-07 14:45:41 -0700

  * Release 2.2.0.

2.1.2-22 | 2020-07-07 14:44:57 -0700

  * Fix Sphinx add_stylesheet deprecation (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix docstring for Manager.list_depender_pkgs() (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.1.2-20 | 2020-07-07 14:30:45 -0700

  * Add runtime dependency checks for zkg (Mohan Dhawan, Corelight)

    The "load", "unload" and "remove" operations now all analyze package
    dependencies and prompt to any load/unload additional packages as needed
    to satisfy dependencies.

2.1.2-2 | 2020-06-26 12:01:08 -0700

  * Fix '"is" with a literal' warning in Python 3.8+ (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.1.2-1 | 2020-06-04 11:53:04 -0700

  * Update docs for name change of Zeek's aux/ dir (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.1.2 | 2020-04-07 17:29:47 -0700

  * Release 2.1.2.

2.1.1-3 | 2020-04-07 17:28:27 -0700

  * Introduce basic package name validation (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    Installing a package called 'packages' doesn't work because of
    implementation details (and its not sensible anyway).

    This patch adds some light validation of package names. Besides the
    reserved names "packages" and "package", it also rejects package names
    with fronting and trailing whitespace.

2.1.1-1 | 2020-03-20 09:51:50 -0700

  * GH-59: add note to quickstart doc about default pip user script dir (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.1.1 | 2020-03-20 09:28:39 -0700

  * Release 2.1.1.

2.1.0-2 | 2020-03-20 09:26:02 -0700

  * GH-60: Fixup urlparse() usage for Python 2 (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    (Support for end-of-life Python 2 is still planned to be removed shortly)

2.1.0 | 2020-03-18 15:39:50 -0700

  * Release 2.1.0.

2.0.7-12 | 2020-03-18 15:37:52 -0700

  * Add --extra-source command line parameter (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    Allow to specify sources without changing the config file. The current
    approach allows overriding sources specified in the configuration file.

    The option is added to the top-level parser, as a number of commands are
    using the sources.

  * Support `@` in source paths to denote branch/revision to use (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    Allow an `@` character in the path part of an URL to be used as a specifier
    which branch/tag/commit to checkout. Shamelessly copied from `pip` where it
    can be used to specify the revision of a dependency.

  * Move git_checkout from manager to util (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

  * Replace remove_trailing_slashes with rstrip('/') (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

2.0.7-5 | 2020-03-16 15:53:08 -0700

  * Add Cirrus CI config (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.0.7-3 | 2020-02-24 10:12:39 -0800

  * Add missing include header to plugin used for tests (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Do not expect SHELL in environment when running `zkg env` (Arne Welzel)

2.0.7 | 2019-10-14 11:56:18 -0700

  * Release 2.0.7.

2.0.6-3 | 2019-10-14 11:53:46 -0700

  * GH-55: Add fallback option to getting user_vars. (Vlad Grigorescu)

    This generally fixes errors when installing packages that use "user_vars",
    but the user's zkg config file doesn't have a corresponding key.  And that
    can happen simply by (separately) installing multiple packages that each
    use "user_vars".

2.0.6 | 2019-09-20 13:06:48 -0700

  * Release 2.0.6.

2.0.5-2 | 2019-09-20 13:03:11 -0700

  * GH-54: improve error message for package test failures (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve debug logging for test_command (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.0.5 | 2019-09-18 16:16:21 -0700

  * Release 2.0.5.

2.0.4-1 | 2019-09-18 16:09:19 -0700

  * Improve dependency handling (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    It now won't report unsatisfiable dependencies between two nodes in the
    dependency graph that are already installed.  E.g. previously, if one
    used the --nodeps flag to install package "foo" that had a failed
    dependency on Zeek, then installing unrelated package "bar" without
    --nodeps would emit an error about "foo" dependencies being
    unsatisfiable even though that has no relation to the current operation.

2.0.4 | 2019-08-28 15:50:13 -0700

  * Release 2.0.4.

2.0.3-2 | 2019-08-28 15:49:54 -0700

  * Bugfix: incorrect arguments to Manager.has_plugin() (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

2.0.3 | 2019-08-26 14:18:12 -0700

  * Release 2.0.3.

2.0.2-2 | 2019-08-26 14:16:36 -0700

  * When loading/unloading a Zeek package, also enable/disable any plugin (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This patch does this via renaming of the __bro_plugin__ magic file
    that Zeek looks for when scanning ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH. To disable a
    plugin, zkg renames the file to __bro_plugin__.disabled, and renames
    that file back to __bro_plugin__ when enabling.

2.0.2 | 2019-07-17 10:46:14 -0700

  * Release 2.0.2.

2.0.1-2 | 2019-07-17 10:44:50 -0700

  * Simplify how "current_hash" is determined for installed packages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    For packages installed via version tag, this will also change the
    meaning of "current_hash" from being the hexsha of the tag object itself
    to the hexsha of the commit object pointed to by the tag.

2.0.1 | 2019-07-09 10:37:20 -0700

  * Release 2.0.1.

2.0.0-1 | 2019-07-09 10:36:27 -0700

  * Fix a broken link in docs (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.0.0 | 2019-06-11 19:33:36 -0700

  * Release 2.0.0.

1.7.0-30 | 2019-06-11 19:33:13 -0700

  * Fix version string replacement via update-changes (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

1.7.0-29 | 2019-06-11 19:26:22 -0700

  * Update packaging scripts (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The new name on PyPi will be "zkg", but a duplicate package (with
    the same version number) under the old "bro-pkg" name is still
    built and uploaded along with it.

  * Change name of "bro_dist" Manager ctor arg to "zeek_dist" (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Note this is a breaking API change for those that were creating
    Manager objects using "bro_dist" as a named parameter.

  * Add manager.zeekpath and manager.zeek_plugin_path methods (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Same as manager.bropath and manager.bro_plugin_path.

  * Rename internal util functions that had "bro" in them (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Replace "Bro" with "Zeek" in all documentation (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Replace "bro" usages in unit tests (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Support zkg.index files within package sources (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    bro-pkg.index files, if they exist within a package source, are also
    still accepted and treated in the same way as before.

  * Allow "zeek" and "zkg" in the "depends" metadata field (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    These are equivalent to the "bro" and "bro-pkg" dependencies that
    already existed.

  * Add preference for zkg.meta over bro-pkg.meta files (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The new, preferred package metadata file name is zkg.meta, but we'll
    still accept a bro-pkg.meta if that's all that exists.

  * Add zeek_dist config option (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This is treated the same way "bro_dist" worked, which is also still
    used as a fallback if no "zeek_dist" value is set.

    Package metadata files also now allow either "%(bro_dist)s" or
    "%(zeek_dist)s" substitutions.

  * Rename example config file to zkg.config (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Change default package source name/url from bro to zeek (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Change default config and state dirs to ~/.zkg (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The old, default ~/.bro-pkg will still be used if it already exists
    so users will be able to keep their current configurations without
    having to start over from scratch.

  * Add support for using zeek-config script (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    With fallback to using bro-config if it exists.

  * Support new Zeek environment variables (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    - ZEEKPATH (BROPATH still used as fallback)
    - ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH (BRO_PLUGIN_PATH still used as fallback)

  * Rename bro-pkg man page to zkg (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Allow ZKG_CONFIG_FILE environment variable (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Same functionality as the old BRO_PKG_CONFIG_FILE (which is still
    used as a fallback).

  * Rename internal env. var. used by setup.py (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove gh-pages Makefile target (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add zeekpkg module (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The old bropkg module now emits deprecation warnings.

  * Add zkg executable file (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The bro-pkg script still exists as a wrapper that prints a deprecation
    warning by default.

1.7.0-7 | 2019-05-03 19:59:57 -0700

  * Improve test_command failure output (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

1.7.0-6 | 2019-04-26 10:22:58 -0700

  * Fix error when upgrading from older bro-pkg (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

1.5.6-3 | 2019-04-03 15:09:23 -0700

  * Include bro-pkg.meta file info in the "bro-pkg info" output. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Track the full bro-pkg.meta filename in package.PackageInfo. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

1.5.6 | 2019-03-27 14:18:39 -0700

  * Release 1.5.0.

1.4.2-2 | 2018-12-12 15:31:47 -0600

  * Add an 'aliases' package metadata field (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This is used for specifying alternate package names that one may @load
    it by, and may be generally useful when renaming package repositories
    while still supporting existing package installations under the old name.

  * Fix bro-pkg to be able to upgrade packages no longer in a source
    (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

1.4.2 | 2018-08-03 16:46:21 -0500

1.3.1-2 | 2018-02-01 16:13:25 -0600

  * Teach bro-pkg to emit an error when operating on dirty git clones

    When trying to use the install, test, or bundle commands on local git
    clones that have modifications or untracked files, bro-pkg now aborts
    with an error message.  This is to help catch situations where one
    thinks their uncommitted local changes will be installed by bro-pkg, but
    actually will not be unless they are committed in the git repo. (Corelight)

1.3.1-1 | 2018-02-01 15:43:19 -0600

  * Fix install command to be able to re-install an existing package

    Before, using 'install' on a previously-installed package would not
    correctly update the cached git repository so if there were any changes
    since the last installation they would not be seen after the operation
    completed. (Corelight)

1.3.1 | 2017-12-07 19:33:23 -0600

  * Release 1.3.

1.2.6-2 | 2017-11-28 19:29:38 -0600

  * GH-22: add a 'suggests' metadata field

    This new field can be used in the same way as 'depends', but is used for
    packages that are merely complementary and not strictly required for the
    suggesting package to function.

    A "(suggested)" indicator for install, bundle, and upgrade commands will
    now appear during their bro-pkg confirmation prompts.  These commands
    also now have a --nosuggestions flag to ignore all suggested packages.

    This changes the bropkg.manager.validate_dependencies() API to return
    an additional boolean indicating whether a package was included in the
    list as a result of suggestions. (Corelight)

1.2.6-1 | 2017-11-27 09:46:02 -0600

    This allows packages to depend on new features of bro-pkg not available
    in previous version. (Jon Siwek)

1.1 | 2017-09-28 18:46:30 -0500

  * Release 1.1.

1.0.4-32 | 2017-09-28 18:45:54 -0500

  * BIT-1852: allow plugin_dir to also accept tarfiles

    This allows packagers to specify a tarfile containing the Bro plugin
    instead of a directory.  May be useful as the default Bro plugin
    CMake skeleton will end up producing a tarfile as part of the plugin
    build process that contains the minimal set of files comprising the
    plugin. (Jon Siwek)

1.0.4-31 | 2017-09-28 16:16:39 -0500

  * GH-9: add new 'user_vars' bro-pkg.meta field and config file section

    This field allows for packages to solicit users for extra configuration
    settings which may then be referenced in that package's build_command.
    Useful for asking users for installation paths of external dependencies,
    which may differ between users/systems. (Jon Siwek)

1.0.4-30 | 2017-09-27 11:14:52 -0500

  * GH-9: show 'external_depends' metadata during 'unbundle' command (Jon Siwek)

  * Add manager.bundle_info() to API.

    It retrieves information on all packages in a bundle without installing
    the bundle. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add 'depends' bro-pkg.meta field. (Jon Siwek)

  * Teach install/upgrade/bundle commands to operate on package dependencies.

    These commands now construct a dependency graph based on the packages
    the user has requested plus any already-installed packages and then
    validates the graph to make sure there are no dependency conflicts.

    If there are no conflicts, then the set of requested packages get
    installed/bundled along with any additional packages that were required
    to satisfy dependencies.  For those additional packages, bro-pkg always
    tries to pick the latest release version that satisfies all dependency
    specifications. (Jon Siwek)

0.9-2 | 2017-01-09 11:16:43 -0600

  * Fix bundle/unbundle automatic lower-casing of urls in bundle manifest
    (Jon Siwek)

0.8-4 | 2016-12-08 19:50:49 -0600

  * Add new bro-pkg.meta field: config_files

    This allows package authors to specify a list of files that users may
    directly modify.  The upgrade, remove, install, and bundle operations
    all work in a way that attempts to either preserve a user's local
    changes or save a backup of their version. (Jon Siwek)

    - add --aggregate flag to refresh command that will crawl packages and
      aggregate their metadata into an aggregate.meta file within local
      package source clones

    - add --sources flag to refresh command to explicitly specify operation
      on a specific set of package sources

    - add --push flag to refresh command to push local package source
      aggregate.meta changes to the remote repo (Jon Siwek)

  * BIT-1715: improve message when failing to clone a package source

0.7-2 | 2016-10-03 16:49:24 -0500
