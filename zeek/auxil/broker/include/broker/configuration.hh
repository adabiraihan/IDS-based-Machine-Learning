/// The configuration draws user-provided options from three sources (in order):
/// 1. The file `broker.conf`. Contents of this file override hard-coded
///    defaults. Broker only scans the current working directory when looking
///    for this file.
/// 2. Environment variables. Broker currently recognizes the following
///    environment variables:
///    - `BROKER_CONSOLE_VERBOSITY`: enables console output by overriding
///      `logger.console-verbosity`. Valid values are `trace`, `debug`, `info`,
///      `warning`, and `error`.
///    - `BROKER_FILE_VERBOSITY`: enables log file output by overriding
///      `logger.file-verbosity`.
///    - `BROKER_RECORDING_DIRECTORY` enables recording of meta data for the
///      `broker-cluster-benchmark` tool.
///    - `BROKER_OUTPUT_GENERATOR_FILE_CAP` restricts the number of recorded
///      messages in recording mode.
/// 3. Command line arguments (if provided).
///
/// As a rule of thumb, set `BROKER_CONSOLE_VERBOSITY` to `info` for getting
/// output on high-level events such as peerings. If you need to tap
/// into published messages, set `BROKER_CONSOLE_VERBOSITY` to `debug`. Enabling
/// debug output will slow down Broker and generates a lot of console output.
///
/// Writing to a file instead of printing to the command line can help grepping
/// through large logs or correlating logs from multiple Broker peers.
