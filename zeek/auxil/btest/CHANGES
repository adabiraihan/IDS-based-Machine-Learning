0.69 | 2021-06-07 09:33:51 +0200

  * Release 0.69.


0.68-9 | 2021-06-07 09:31:03 +0200

  * Documentation updates. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    - Add a section on running btest, to give some basic context.
    - Add more detail on btest invocation and test selection.
    - Update docs for download and installation, shifting focus to PyPI.
    - Move TEST-START-NEXT description to its section.

0.68-4 | 2021-06-01 18:34:04 +0200

  * Alternatives: Update `baselinedir` default after potentially
    changing testbase. (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

0.68-2 | 2021-06-01 08:53:42 +0200

  * Fix issue where global configuration object wasn't updated for
    environment variables taken from alternatives. (Arne Welzel,
    Corelight)

  * Ignore environment variable when overridden by alternative. (Arne
    Welzel, Corelight)

0.68 | 2021-04-16 16:21:36 -0700

  * Release 0.68.

0.67-2 | 2021-04-16 16:21:14 -0700

  * Preserve CRLF line-terminators in test files (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Since the test itself may depend on their existence.

    Related to https://github.com/zeek/zeek/issues/1497

0.67 | 2021-01-21 13:27:20 -0800

  * Release 0.67.

0.66-2 | 2021-01-21 13:26:58 -0800

  * Support BTest installation via CMake (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This copies the relevant files manually. Relying on setup.py is
    feasible but requires careful separation of build and source
    directories, so currently explicit file lists are easier to maintain.

0.66 | 2021-01-08 12:14:24 +0000

  * Bug fix to apply TEST-REQUIRES to tests duplicated with TEST-START-NEXT.
    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.65 | 2020-12-07 09:32:03 +0000

  * Release 0.65.

0.64-21 | 2020-12-07 09:01:13 +0000

  * Default to `-j 1` to make CTRL-C work consistently. We now always use
    multiprocessing with a single process, with one exception: interactive
    baseline updates still run directly. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Avoid leaking processes due to lacking sync manager shutdown.
    (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Speed up the threading test since its built-in delays weren't actually
    required for the test. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

0.64-18 | 2020-12-07 08:44:55 +0000

  * Add "binary mode" to btest-diff. In binary mode, invoked with -b/--binary,
    btest-diff compares test output and baselines for equality only, never
    applies canonifiers, and doesn't apply our btest header when updating
    baselines. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

0.64-16 | 2020-12-07 08:35:25 +0000

  * GH-36: Fix --abort-on-failure for expected failures. (Robin Sommer,
    Corelight)

0.64-14 | 2020-12-01 16:05:25 +0000

  * Add support for multiple baseline directories. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    This works be setting the environment variable BTEST_BASELINE_DIR to a
    colon-separated list of directories. They will be searched in order when
    looking a baseline file to compare against. Updating a baseline will always
    put the new content into the first directory. One can now also generally
    set a different baseline directory through BTEST_BASELINE_DIR. See the
    README for more.

  * Require Python >= 3.5. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

0.64-1 | 2020-11-11 12:57:12 +0000

  * Fix for Python 3. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.64 | 2020-10-20 14:02:01 +0000

  * Fix canonification problem. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.63 | 2020-10-20 08:32:28 +0000

  * Add support for minimum BTest version requirement in the config
    file. If an entry called "MinVersion" is present in the "btest"
    section, it spells out a minimum version that BTest must have in
    order to run. If that condition isn't fulfilled, we exit with
    error code 1 and a corresponding error message on stderr.
    (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * GH-29: Add new options -F/--abort-on-failure that will abort once
    at least one test has failed. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Documentation and code cleanup. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

0.62-13 | 2020-10-09 07:33:49 +0000

  * Canonify outputs when updating baselines via btest-diff.
    (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This leverages the same canonicalization btest-diff already
    applies during test output comparison against baselines also when
    updating those baselines (usually via btest -U/-u). This removes a
    bunch of noise from the baselines, including personal home
    directories, timestamps, etc.

    Since btest-diff doesn't know whether the baseline has undergone
    this canonicalization, it continues to canonicalize the baseline
    prior to diffing. To track whether it has canonicalized a baseline
    when updating, btest-diff now also prepends a header to the
    generated baseline that warns users about the fact that it is
    auto-generated. The presence of this header doubles as a marker
    for canonicalization.

  * Clean up btest-diff's shell code. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

0.62-7 | 2020-09-24 07:47:26 -0700

  * GH-26: Explicitly use multiprocessing "fork" start-method (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The default start-method on macOS in Python 3.8+ is "spawn", but that
    emits a RuntimeError with current btest structuring.

0.62-5 | 2020-08-25 07:57:23 +0000

  * GH-11: Fix %DIR not being set correctly in cloned tests. (Jon
    Siwek, Corelight)

  * Sort XML attributes for more output stability across Python
    versions. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Use Sphinx logging API directly for compatibility with Sphinx
    2.0+. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

0.62 | 2020-05-08 15:07:11 +0000

  * Release 0.62.

0.61-10 | 2020-05-08 15:05:46 +0000

  * Catch keyboard interrupt to abort orderly and immediately. The
    existing workers will still run to completion in the background.
    (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.61-8 | 2020-04-28 10:00:41 +0000

  * Add `--trace-file` option for recording Chrome trace file.
    (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

0.61-2 | 2020-02-13 18:53:41 +0000

  * Provide a more apt description for btest. (Christopher M. Hobbs,
    Corelight)

0.61 | 2020-02-07 10:19:25 +0000

  * Release 0.61.

0.6-4 | 2020-02-07 10:18:14 +0000

  * Change --retries option to not increment test name on retries.
    (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix retrying tests that use additional files. (Jon Siwek,
    Corelight)

0.60 | 2020-01-17 09:13:56 +0000

  * Show diagnostics for expected failures when --diagnostics-all is
    used. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Fix btest exit code to indicate success if only tests are failing
    that are expected to. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Extend XML test case to cover -j flag. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix XML output option -x to work with -j. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

0.59-12 | 2019-09-09 11:30:26 +0000

  * Add timestamps to "btest-progress" output. They are added to
    stderr only, so that they will get recorded but not displayed
    during execution. The new option -T suppresses the timestamp. (DJ
    Gregor, Corelight)

0.59-8 | 2019-08-16 16:15:41 +0000

  * New option -z <RETRIES> to retry any failed tests a few times to

0.58-12 | 2019-08-01 12:02:01 -0700

  * Drop use of Python 2.6 for Travis CI tests (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

0.58-11 | 2019-06-27 16:54:17 +0000

  * Adding clarity to difficult to understand error message. (Sam
    Zaydel, Corelight)

0.58-9 | 2019-06-17 20:17:32 -0700

  * Update Travis config for bro to zeek renaming (Daniel Thayer)

0.58-7 | 2019-05-24 16:16:07 +0000

  * Use more portable platform.system() for determining platform name.
    (woot4moo)

0.58-5 | 2018-12-07 16:32:52 -0600

  * Update github/download link (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

0.58-4 | 2018-11-29 16:55:33 -0600

  * Add TEST-PORT command and PortRange option (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    These control assignment of TCP ports to environment variables for
    use during test execution.  Helps in writing unit tests that can be
    run concurrently or just in reducing the risk of a unit test failing
    due to a port already being used by some external process.

0.58 | 2018-05-21 22:32:21 +0000

  * Release 0.58.

0.57-32 | 2018-05-21 22:31:42 +0000

  * Show number of skipped tests even when none fail. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Delete a test's temporary directory if skipped, unless the user
    wants these. (Corelight)

0.57-28 | 2018-05-08 10:03:20 -0500

  * BIT-1735: open btest files as utf-8 if locale has no default encoding
    (Corelight)

  * Normalize output of a sphinx-related unit test (Corelight)

  * Improve a unicode decode error message (Daniel Thayer)

0.57-24 | 2018-04-18 14:56:56 -0700

  * Improving console output. (Robin Sommer)

        - When showing a progress message, always clear to end of line
          to delete any content that a previous, longer message may
          have left.

        - Ensure to turn the cursor back on at exit.

0.57-23 | 2018-03-15 14:58:20 -0700

    -A|--show-all, which makes console output preserve output lines
    for passing/skipped tests.  (Christian Kreibich)

  * Fix btest-rst-cmd script to remove tmp files. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Added TMPDIR to btest.cfg so that temporary files are stored in a

0.56-5 | 2017-01-24 08:45:29 -0800

  * Bugfix for recent btest-progress changes. (Robin Sommer)

0.56-4 | 2017-01-23 19:59:59 -0800

  * New utility btest-progress to display progress messages while a
    test is executing. These messages appear in real-time while the
    rest is still running. When stdout is a tty, the progress messages
    are incorporated into the colored one-line status message. By
    default, btest-progress also prints the message to a test's
    standard output. That can be suppressed by giving it an option -q.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Experimental automatic generation of test reference documentation.
    The new command-line option "-R <format>" prints out a list of all
    tests in either Markdown (format 'md') or reStructuredText (format
    'rst'). The list includes a documentation string with each test
    that gets defined through a new "@TEST-DOC: <docstring>"
    directive. This is experimental. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fix pylint warnings. (Robin Sommer)

0.56 | 2016-10-31 14:23:57 -0700

0.54-58 | 2015-10-01 16:04:51 -0700

  * Improved test of TEST_DIFF_FILE_MAX_LINES. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Added ability for a user to override the default number of lines
    to show for diffs by setting the environment variable
    TEST_DIFF_FILE_MAX_LINES. Reduced the default to 100. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * When no baseline exists, changed btest-diff to always just show
    the entire file. (Daniel Thayer)

0.54-55 | 2015-08-25 07:47:22 -0700

  * Port to Python 3. (Daniel Thayer)

    (Robin Sommer)

0.51-6 | 2014-02-06 18:19:08 -0800

  * Adding a timing mode that records test execution times per host.
    This is for catching regressions (or improvements :) that lets
    execution times divert significantly. Linux only for now. See the
    README for more information. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding color to test status when writing to console. (Robin Sommer)

  * A bit of refactoring to define the status messages ("ok", "failed")
    only at a single location.

    Also added a note when a test declared as expecting failure in fact
    succeeds. (Robin Sommer)


0.51-2 | 2013-11-17 20:21:08 -0800

  * New keyword ``TEST-KNOWN-FAILURE`` to mark tests that are
    currently known to fail. (Robin Sommer)

0.51-1 | 2013-11-11 13:36:36 -0800

          via the new "btest-include" and "btest-cmd" classes.

        - Fix to enable showing line numbers in btest-sphinx generated
          output.

    (Daniel Thayer)

  * A set of changes to Sphinx commands and directives. (Robin Sommer)

    btest-rst-*:
        - Always show line numbers.

        - Highlight the command executed.

        - rst-cmd-include gets an option -n <i> to include only upto i lines.

        - rst-cmd-include prefixes output with "<file>" to show what we're
          including.

    btest-include:
        - Set Pygments language automatically if we show a file with an
          extension we know (in particular ".bro").

        - Prefix output with "<file>" to show what we're including.

0.4-63 | 2013-08-28 21:10:39 -0700

  * btest-sphinx now provides a new directive btest-include. This
    works like literalinclude (with all its options) but it also saves
    a version of the included text as a test to detect changes. (Robin
    Sommer)

0.4-55 | 2013-08-22 16:09:21 -0700

  * New "Sphinx-mode" for BTest, activated with -S. This allows to
    capture a test's diagnostic output when running from inside
    Sphinx; the output will now be inserted into the generated
    document. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding an option -n to btest-rst-cmd that truncates output longer
    than N lines. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding a PartFinalizer that runs a commmand at the completion of
    each test part. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-51 | 2013-08-22 10:36:34 -0700

  * Improve cleanup of processes that don't terminate with
    btest-bg-wait. (Jon Siwek)

0.4-49 | 2013-08-13 18:43:03 -0700

  * Fixing test portability problems. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Adding TEST_BASE environment variable. The existing TESTBASE isn't
    always behaving as expected and wasn't documented to begin with.
    (Robin Sommer)

0.4-43 | 2013-08-12 16:04:53 -0700

  * Bugfix for ignored tests. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-42 | 2013-07-31 20:46:30 -0700

  * Adding support for "parts": One can split a single test across
    multiple files by adding a numerical ``#<n>`` postfix to their
    names, where each ``<n>`` represents a separate part of the test.
    ``btests`` will combine all of a test's parts in numerical order
    and execute them subsequently within the same sandbox. Example in
    the README. (Robin Sommer)

  * When running a command, TEST_PART contains the current part
    number. (Robin Sommer)

  * Extending Sphinx support. (Robin Sommer)

        * Adding tests for Sphinx functionality.

        * Support for parts in Sphinx directives. If multiple btest
          directives reference the same test name, each will turn into
          a part of a single test.

        * Internal change restructuring the btest Sphinx directive. We
          now process it in two passes: one to save the test at parse
          time, and one later to execute once everything has been
          parsed.

        * Adding Sphinx sandbox for testing.

  * Fix for tests returning no output to render at all. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-28 | 2013-07-17 21:56:18 -0700

  * btest-diff now passes the name of the file under consideration on to
    canonifiers. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-27 | 2013-07-14 21:19:59 -0700

  * When searching for tests, BTest now ignores a directories if it finds
    a file ".btest-ignore" in there. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-26 | 2013-07-08 20:46:22 -0700

  * Fixing bug with @TEST-START-NEXT naming. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-25 | 2013-07-08 13:25:50 -0700

  * A test-suite for btest. Using, of course, btest. "make test" will
    test most of btest's features. The main missing piece is testing
    the Sphinx support, we will add that next. (Robin Sommer)

  * When creating directories, we know also create intermediaries.
    That in particular means that "@TEST-START-FILE a/b/c" now creates
    a directory "a/b" automatically and puts the file in there. (Robin
    Sommer)

  * IgnoreDirs now also works for sub directories. (Robin Sommer)

  * Documentation updates. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding "Initializer" option, which runs a command before each
    test. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding "CommandPrefix" option that changes the naming of all btest
    commands by replacing the "@TEST-" prefix with a custom string.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Default configuration file can be overriden via BTEST_CFG
    environment variable. (Robin Sommer)

  * s/bro-ids.org/bro.org/g (Robin Sommer)

  * Bugfix for -j without number. (Robin Sommer)

  * New @TEST-ALTERNATIVE that activates tests only for the given
    alternative. Renamed @TEST-NO-ALTERNATIVE to
    @TEST-NOT-ALTERNATIVE, and allowing "default" for both
    @TEST-ALTERNATIVE and @TEST-NOTALTERNATIVE to specify the case
    that BTest runs without any alternative given. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fix for alternative names containing white spaces. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-14 | 2013-01-23 18:11:22 -0800

  * Fixing links in README and removing TODOs. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-13 | 2013-01-23 14:33:23 -0800

  * Allowing use of -j without a value. BTest then uses the number of
    CPU cores as reported by the OS. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-11 | 2013-01-21 17:50:40 -0800

  * Adding a new "alternative" concept that combines filters and
    substitutions, and adds per-alternative environment variables.
    (Robin Sommer)

    Instead of defining filters and substitutions separately, one now
    specifies an alternative configuration to run with "-A <name>" and
    that then checks for both "[substitutions-<name>]" and
    "[filter-<name>]" section. In addition, "[environment-<name>]"
    allows to define alternative-specific environment variables.

    The old filter/substitutions options -F and -s are gone. The
    sections for substitutions are renamed to "[substitutions-<name>]"
    from "[subst-<name>]".

0.4-10 | 2013-01-07 09:45:35 -0800

  * btest now sets a new environment variable TEST_VERBOSE, giving the
    path of a file where a test can record further information about
    its execution that will be included with btest's ``--verbose``
    output. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-9 | 2012-12-20 12:20:44 -0800

  * Documentation fixes/clarifications. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix the btest "-c" option, which didn't work when the specified
    config file was not in the current working directory. (Daniel
    Thayer)

0.4-6 | 2012-11-08 16:33:51 -0800

  * Putting a limit on how many input line btest-diff shows. (Robin
    Sommer)

0.4-5 | 2012-11-01 16:14:29 -0700

  * Making Sphinx module tolerant against docutils version change.
    (Robin Sommer)

0.4-4 | 2012-09-25 06:24:59 -0700

  * Fix a couple of reST formatting problems. (Daniel Thayer)

0.4-2 | 2012-09-24 11:41:06 -0700

  * Add option -x to output test results in an XML (JUnit-like)
    format. (Jon Siwek)

0.4 | 2012-06-15 15:15:13 -0700

  * Remove code to expand environment variables on command line. (Not
    needed because the command line is just passed to the shell.)
    (Daniel Thayer)

  * Clarify explanation about expansion of environment variables.
    (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix errors in README and btest help output; added documentation
    for the -q option. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fixed a bug in btest where it was looking for "filters-" (instead
    of "filter-") in the btest config file. (Daniel Thayer)

0.31-45 | 2012-05-24 16:43:14 -0700

  * Correct typos in documentation. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Failed tests are now only recorded into the state file when we're
    not updating. That allows to run "btest -r" repeatedly while
    updating baselines in between. (Robin Sommer)

  * Experimentation Sphinx directive to write a btest with a Sphinx
    document. See README for more information.

  * Fixing typos, plus an console output tweak. (Robin Sommer)

  * Option -q now implies -b as well. (Robin Sommer)

0.31-33 | 2012-05-13 17:08:15 -0700

  * New command to copy a file into a test's directory.

    ``@TEST-COPY-FILE: <file>``
        Copy the given file into the test's directory before the test is
        run. If ``<file>`` is a relative path, it's interpreted relative
        to the BTest's base directory. Environment variables in ``<file>``
        will be replaced if enclosed in ``${..}``. This command can be
        given multiple times. (Robin Sommer)

  * Suppressing error messages when btest-diff can't remove diag file.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding option -q/--quiet to suppress informational non-error
    output. (Robin Sommer)

  * Option -F also takes a comma-separated list to specify multiple
    filters , rather than having to give -F multiple times. (Robin
    Sommer)

0.31-28 | 2012-05-06 21:27:15 -0700

  * Separating semantics of groups and thread serialization into
    separate options. -g still specifices @TEST-GROUPs that are to be
    executed, but these groups don't any longer control which tests
    get serialized in a parallel execution. For that, there's a new
    "@TEST-SERIALIZE: <tag>" command that takes a tag and then makes
    sure all tests with the same tag are run within the same thread.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * TEST-GROUPS can now be given multiple times now to assign a test
    to a set of groups. (Robin Sommer)

  * Extended -g to accept a comma-separated list of groups names to
    run more than one test group. (Robin Sommer)

  * New output handler for console output. This output is now the
    default when stdout is a terminal. It prints out a compressed
    output that updates as btest goes through; it also indicates the
    progress so far. If btest's output is redirected to a
    non-terminal, is switches back to the old style. (Robin Sommer)

  * New test command @TEST-NO-FILTER: <filter>

    This allows to ignore a test when running a specific filter. (Robin Sommer)

  * Changing the way filters are activated.

    -F <filter> now activates only the given filter, but doesn't run
    the standard tests in addition. But one can now give -F a
    command-separated list of filters to activate them all, and refer
    to the standard tests without filter as ``-``. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fix to allow numbered test to be given individually on the command
    line. (E.g., integer.geq-3 for a file that contains three tests).
    (Robin Sommer)


0.31-23 | 2012-04-16 18:10:02 -0700

  * A number of smaller fixes for bugs, plus polishing, caused by the
    recent restructuring. (Robin Sommer)

  * Removing the error given when using -r with tests on the command
    line. It's unnessary and confusing compared to when listing tests
    in btest.cfg. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding a new "finalizer" option.

    ``Finalizer``
        An executable that will be executed each time any test has
        succesfully run. It runs in the same directory as the test itself
        and receives the name of the test as its parameter. The return
        value indicates whether the test should indeed be considered
        succeeded. By default, there's no finalizer set. (Robin Sommer)

  * btest is now again overwriting old diag files instead of appending
    (i.e., back to as it used to be). (Robin Sommer)

  * Diag output is now line-buffered. (Daniel Thayer)


0.31-13 | 2012-03-13 15:59:51 -0700

  * Adding new option -r that reruns all tests that failed last time.
    btest now always records all failed tests in a file called. (Robin
    Sommer)

  * Internal restructuring to factor output out into sublcasses.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding parallel test execution to btest. (Robin Sommer)

        - A new option "-j <n>" allows to run up to <n> tests in
          parallel.

        - A new @TEST-GROUP directive allows to group tests that can't
          be parallelized. All tests of the same group will be
          executed sequentially.

        - A new option "-g <group>" allows to run only tests of a
          certain group, or with "-g -" all tests that don't have a
          group.


0.31-2 | 2012-01-25 16:58:29 -0800

  * Don't add btest's path to PATH anymore. (Jon Siwek)

0.31 | 2011-11-29 12:11:49 -0600

  * Submodule README conformity changes. (Jon Siwek)

0.3 | 2011-10-25 19:58:26 -0700

  * More graceful error handling at startup if btest.cfg not found.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Python 2.4 compat changes. (Jon Siwek)

  * When in brief mode, btest-diff now shows full output if we don't
    have a baseline yet. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding executable permission back to script. (Robin Sommer)

  * Cleaning up distribution. (Robin Sommer)

0.22-28 | 2011-09-15 15:18:11 -0700

  * New environment variable TEST_DIFF_BRIEF. If set btest-diff no
    longer includes a mismatching file's full content it the
    diagnostic output. This can be useful if the file being compared
    is very large. (Robin Sommer)

0.22-27 | 2011-08-12 22:56:12 -0700

  * Fix btest-bg-wait's kill trap and -k option. (Jon Siwek)

0.22-18 | 2011-07-23 11:54:07 -0700

  * A new option -u for interactively updating baselines.

  * Teach btest's TEST-START-FILE to make subdirectories (Jon Siwek)

  * Output polishing. (Robin Sommer)

  * Have distutils install 'btest-setsid' script. (Jon Siwek)

  * A portable setsid. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fixes for background execution of processes.

  * Fixing exit codes. (Robin Sommer)

0.22-6 | 2011-07-19 17:38:03 -0700

  * Teach btest's TEST-START-FILE to make subdirectories (Jon Siwek)

0.22-5 | 2011-05-02 08:41:34 -0700

  * A number of bug fixes, and output polishing. (Robin Sommer)

  * More robust background execution by btest-bg-*. (Robin Sommer)

0.22-4 | 2011-03-29 21:38:13 -0700

  * A test command can now signal to btest that even if it fails
    subsequent test commands should still run by returning exit code 100.
    btest-diff uses this to continue in the case that no baseline has
    yet been established.

  * New test option @TEST-REQUIRES for running a test conditionally.
    See the README for more information.

0.22-2 | 2011-03-03 21:44:18 -0800

  * Two new helper scripts for spawning processes in the background.
    See README for more information.

  * btest-diff can now deal with files specificied with paths.

0.22 | 2011-02-08 14:06:13 -0800

  * BTest is now hosted along with the other Bro repositories on
    git.bro-ids.org.

0.21 | 2011-01-09 21:29:18 -0800

  * In btest.cfg, option values can now include commands to execute in
    backticks.

    Example:

        [environment]
        CC=clang -emit-llvm -g `hilti-config --cflags`

  * Limiting substitutions to replacing whole words.

  * Adding "substitutions". Substitutions are similar to filters, yet
    they do not adapt the input but the command line being exectued.
    See README for more information.

  * Instead of giving a test's file name on the command line, one can
    now also use its "dotted" name as it's printed out when btest is
    running (e.g., "foo.bar"). That allows for easier copy/paste.

  * Starting CHANGES.
