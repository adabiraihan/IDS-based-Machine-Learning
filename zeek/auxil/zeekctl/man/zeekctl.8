.SH NAME
.B zeekctl
\- interactive shell for managing Zeek installations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zeekctl
[\fIcommand\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B zeekctl
is an interactive interface for managing either a standalone or a Zeek cluster
installation.  If a \fBzeekctl\fR command is specified directly on the
command-line, then \fBzeekctl\fR performs the action associated with
that command immediately (instead of running the interactive interface).

Before actually running
.B zeekctl
you first need to edit the \fBzeekctl.cfg\fR, \fBnode.cfg\fR, and
\fBnetworks.cfg\fR files. In the \fBzeekctl.cfg\fR file, you should
review the \fBzeekctl\fR options and make sure the options are set
correctly for your environment. Next, edit the \fBnode.cfg\fR
file and specify the nodes that you will be running. Finally, edit
the \fBnetworks.cfg\fR file and list each network that is considered
local to the monitored environment (see the examples
in the file for the format to use).

When running \fBzeekctl\fR for the first time, you must run the \fBzeekctl\fR
\fBdeploy\fR command before running any other commands in order to apply the
configuration settings.  You must also run \fBzeekctl deploy\fR each time
you change the configuration (including any Zeek scripts) or upgrade Zeek.
