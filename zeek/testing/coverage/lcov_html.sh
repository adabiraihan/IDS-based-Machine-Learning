Usage: $0 <options>

  Generate coverage data for the Zeek code. This uses data generated during btest,
  so those should be run prior to calling this script. By default, this script
  generates an HTML report in the coverage-html directory in the root of the Zeek
  repo.

  Options:
    --help             Display this output.
    --html DIR         This is the default mode, but this argument can be passed
                       to make it explicit. It also can be used to pass an optional
                       destination directory for the HTML output.
    --coveralls TOKEN  Report coverage data to Coveralls.io using the specified
                       repo token. Enabling this option disables the HTML report.
                       This option requires the coveralls-lcov Ruby gem to be
                       installed.
