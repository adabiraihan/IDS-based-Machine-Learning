# This test is mainly checking the request_body_len field for correctness.
# Historical versions of Zeek would mistakenly count the body-lengths of the
# multipart sub-entities twice: once upon the end of the sub-entity and then
# again upon the end of the top-level enitity that contains all sub-entities.
# The size of just the top-level enitity is the correct one to use.
